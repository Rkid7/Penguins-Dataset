# Penguins-Dataset
Penguins dataset: 344 rows Ã— 7 cols (species, island, bill/flipper dimensions, body mass, sex). Mix of numerical/categorical data. NaN values present. Used for classification (species prediction), regression, EDA. Models: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes. Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrices. Feature importance aids interpretation.
The dataset is the "Penguins" dataset, which contains information about different species of penguins. Here's a breakdown of the dataset:

### Dataset Characteristics:

1. Number of Rows: 344
2. Number of Columns: 7

Column Descriptions:

1. species: The species of the penguin (e.g., Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap).
2. Island: The island where the penguin was observed (e.g., Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream).
3. Bill_length_mm: The length of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
4. Bill_depth_mm: The depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
5. Flipper_length_mm: The length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters.
6. Body_mass_g: The body mass of the penguin in grams.
7. Sex: The sex of the penguin (Male or Female).

### Data Types:

- Numerical columns: *bill_length_mm*, *bill_depth_mm*, *flipper_length_mm*, *body_mass_g*
- Categorical columns: *species*, *island*, *sex*

### Missing Values:

The dataset contains missing values (NaN) in some rows, particularly in the numerical columns.

### Potential Uses:

1. Classification: The dataset can be used for classification tasks, such as predicting the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.
2. Regression: The dataset can be used for regression tasks, such as predicting the body mass of a penguin based on its other physical characteristics.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset can be used to explore the relationships between different variables and to gain insights into the characteristics of different penguin species.
